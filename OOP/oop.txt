This section is about object oriented programming in python

OOP applies to other languages - Java, C++, etc. 
OOP concepts the same, different syntax 

OOP - interaction of objects in a programs


Integer Class - is a class for the integers. 
Class defines how objects can interact in a program.
Try adding Integer class w/ a String class, get an error (cannot add integer to string)

String class has a method called upper() it cannot work on String.

Function class - Functions are objects - a function is an instance of the Function class

What is a class? 
a blueprint that defines how an instance of itself can behave in a program
Ex. "hello" is an instance of the String class, I can run method "hello".upper() 


What is an instance? 
existance of an object of a specific class 

Car class has an instance (object) called mercedes 

What is a method? 
function that acts on an instance of a class 
Ex. .lower from String class, acts on an instance (word) of the string class

Data Type Classes:
all data types in python are an instance of a data type class
Ex. Integer, Boolean, List, Dictionary, Set, Float are all classes with methods (that act on specific instances)
